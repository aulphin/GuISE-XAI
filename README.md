Brain Tumor MRI Dataset , which is utilized is available in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

evening_medi_rise.ipynb : Finetuned is performed in Resnet-50 model utilizing MRI dataset and saved the model.

After that Finetuned model is used for RISE and GuISE method experimentation for medical image dataset of MRI with the demo pynb file
